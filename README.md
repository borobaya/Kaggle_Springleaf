# Kaggle_Springleaf
Code for the Springleaf Marketing Response Kaggle competition

# Notes
Download train.csv and test.csv from https://www.kaggle.com/c/springleaf-marketing-response/data and place within the data folder.

The dataset needs to be processed first before a predictive model can be created. To process data that can be turned into binary format run `binary.py` and `prune.py` within the binary folder and to process data that can be represented numerically, run `pipeline.py` within the numeric folder.

Parameters within the files may need to be tweaked.
